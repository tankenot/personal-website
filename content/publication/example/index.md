abstract: "Securing appropriate driver responses to conflicts is essential in
  automation that is not perfect (because the driver is needed as a fall-back
  for system limitations and failures). However, this is recognized as a major
  challenge in the human factors literature. Moreover, in-depth knowledge is
  lacking regarding mechanisms affecting the driver response process. The first
  aim of this study was to investigate how driver conflict response while using
  highly reliable (but not perfect) supervised automation differ for drivers
  that (a) crash or avoid a conflict object and (b) report high trust or low
  trust in automation to avoid the conflict object. The second aim was to
  understand the influence on the driver conflict response of two specific
  factors: a hands-on-wheel requirement (with vs. without), and the conflict
  object type (garbage bag vs. stationary vehicle). Seventy-six participants
  drove with highly reliable but supervised automation for 30 min on a test
  track. Thereafter they needed to avoid a static object that was revealed by a
  lead-vehicle cut-out. The driver conflict response was assessed through the
  response process: timepoints for driver surprise reaction, hands-on-wheel,
  driver steering, and driver braking. Crashers generally responded later in all
  actions of the response process compared to non-crashers. In fact, some
  crashers collided with the conflict object without even putting their hands on
  the wheel. Driver conflict response was independent of the hands-on-wheel
  requirement. High-trust drivers generally responded later than the low-trust
  drivers or not at all, and only high trust drivers crashed. The larger
  stationary vehicle triggered an earlier surprise reaction compared to the
  garbage bag, while hands-on-wheel and steering response were similar for the
  two conflict object types. To conclude, crashing is associated with a delay in
  all actions of the response process. In addition, driver conflict response
  does not change with a hands-on-wheel requirement but changes with trust-level
  and conflict object type. Simply holding the hands on the wheel is not
  sufficient to prevent collisions or elicit earlier responses. High trust in
  automation is associated with late response and crashing, whereas low trust is
  associated with appropriate driver response. A larger conflict object trigger
  earlier surprise reactions."
