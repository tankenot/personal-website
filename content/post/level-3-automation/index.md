In this post I will introduce you to a specific level of vehicle automation, namely the third level (or Level 3). When I tell people that I do research on automated vehicles, the first question I typically get is: "Oh, cool, but when will we have these automated vehicles?". My answer is always the same: "It depends on what you mean with an automated vehicle." 

The Society of Automotive Engineers has created a document (J3016) which provides definitions for what they refer to as *six levels of driving automation.* If you are interested in this document it can be downloaded here: <!--StartFragment-->
