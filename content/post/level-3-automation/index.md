When I tell people that I do research on automated vehicles, the first question I typically get is: "Oh, cool, but when will we have these automated vehicles?". My answer is always the same: "It depends on what you mean with an automated vehicle." 

The Society of Automotive Engineers has created a document (J3016) which provides definitions for what they refer to as *six levels of driving automation.* If you are interested in this document it can be downloaded here: <!--StartFragment-->

[J3016C: Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to Driving Automation Systems for On-Road Motor Vehicles - SAE International](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3016_202104)

This post focuses on one of these levels, namely the third one referred to as Level 3 or Conditional Driving Automation. Level 3 automation is defined in J3016 as: 

"The sustained and ODD-specific performance by and ADS of the entire DDT under routine/normal operation with the expectation that the DDT fallback-ready user is receptive to ADS-issued requests to intervene, as well as to DDT performance-relevant system failures in other vehicle systems, and will respond appropriately." In other words, a Level 3 system performs the complete driving task (steering, braking and detecting/responding to events) for a sustained period of time. The user does not need to supervise the system, but is expected to be prepared to start to drive (i.e. to become a driver) if the system notifies the user to do so. The assumption for the user of a Level 3 system is that s/he is able to reliably and appropriately focus his/her attention in response to a request to intervene. It is not clearly stated what activities the user is allowed to perform in the J3016. It is also not clear from the document how long time a user is given to respond to a request to intervene and what happens if he or she fails to do so.
