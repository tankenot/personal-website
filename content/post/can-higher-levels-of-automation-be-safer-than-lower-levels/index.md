Have you heard of the six levels of automation? To distinguish between differently advanced automated driving systems, the Society of Automative Engineers (SAE) have divided the range from no automation (manual driving) to full automation (no human required) in six intermediate steps \[1]. If you have driven a traditional manual car, you have already experienced a SAE Level 0 system. If you have also driver car equipped with an adaptive cruise control (ACC), you have also experienced a SAE Level 1 system. While the most advanced automated driving systems on our roads today are SAE Level 2 systems, SAE Level 3 systems are currently being developed.
