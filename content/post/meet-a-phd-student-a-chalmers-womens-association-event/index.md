**General introduction:** I am Linda, 31 years old, from Göteborg, Sweden. I have a bachelor's degree in Mechanical engineering and a Master's degree in applied mechanics (both degrees from Chalmers university of technology). Since 2018, I’m a PhD student at Chalmers at the vehicle safety division. My PhD topic is on Human factors of automated driving. Shortly, when we introduce automation to certain systems we change the role of human operators. In the race towards self-driving cars, this is happening, and we try to understand the consequences of automation on humans. And the aim is to make these self-driven cars safe. The work is interdisciplinary and is a mix of engineering and psychology.
