This blog post shares my personal view of the life as a Swedish PhD student in an engineering field. The first thing that is important to know about doing a PhD is that every journey is *unique.* My experience is based on my circumstances such as my university, my supervisors, my qualifications/strengths and my weaknesses. Your circumstances won't match mine perfectly and your experience will therefore not match mine. 

Life as a PhD student can be cool, stressful, challenging, interesting, fun and sometimes lonely. 

It is *cool* because you get to do research. In simple words this means: working on problems that are not yet solved to establish facts and reach new conclusions. In my work this means investigating how humans behave in automated cars that are not yet to be found on our roads today. 

However, the fact that you typically work on problems without known solutions can also make the life as a PhD student *stressful and challenging* at times. If your PhD includes experimental work it can be stressful not to know if your experiment will work out or fail. If your PhD includes collaboration with others it can be stressful not knowing when they will get back to you with feedback or their work. Your PhD will likely include writing and submitting research papers. It can certainly be stressful not knowing if these papers will be accepted or not. A way to make your PhD student life a little less stressful is to choose your advisor carefully! A good supervisor will understand that a PhD is stressful and will make his/her best in supporting you. 

Life as a PhD student can also be *interesting and fun* since you get time to really dive deep into a topic and you get an excellent chance to improve yourself and steer your work based on your interests. Alongside my previous note on choosing your advisor carefully, an interesting and fun PhD experience will also depend on choosing a topic that you like or are interested in learning more about. You will spend LOTS of time reading up on it, so your experience will be a lot better if you like it. 

Life as a PhD student can be *lonely* at times. How lonely your PhD will be depends on many factors such as your research group, your advisor, your personality etc. If your research group includes a lot of PhD students working together and doing social activities together - great! However, you will likely need to do a lot of work by yourself, since you will likely be working on a topic that no-one or only a few others in the world work on. 

In this post I have noted down some of my thoughts on the PhD student life. As I think you can see, life as a PhD student goes up and down and includes many aspects. 

Best of luck for your choice to become a PhD student. With an interesting topic and a good advisor you've come a long way!
